  On Saturday you can park for free in any non-metered parking spots (green arrows on the map). On Sunday you can park for free anywhere including metered spots (yellow arrows). Do not park in any of the Georgetown spaces - you will get a very heft ticket (~$100) from GU!

  For those of you taking public transportation the D6 Metrobus is probably your best option. Also, Georgetown operates a shuttle from the DuPont and Rosslyn Metro stops but it only runs on Saturday and doesn't start until about noon (see http://otm.georgetown.edu/guts/).
  
  We will be located in the Medical/Dental (aka MedDent) Building on the first floor in room SW107. From Reservoir Road, you want to walk to Entrance 3, take the stairs on your right all the up to the top and then turn left. Keep going past the fountain and then turn right. At this point, the building on your left is MedDent. MedDent SW107 is located just before you get to a large open area and a set of stairs going down. On weekends, the medical center buildings are locked but you can knock to get into SW107.  We will post signs to help direct you.
